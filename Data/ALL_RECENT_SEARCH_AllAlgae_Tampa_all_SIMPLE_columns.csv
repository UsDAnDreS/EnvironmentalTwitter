"22","@hansonji @hookskat I agree! In Pinellas County Florida, the non-potable water was dumped into the Tampa Bay, raising nitrogen levels and causing red tides. And at the same time, fresh ground water was pumped from aquifers and wasted on landscapes and agriculture. This caused salt intrusion in wells.
